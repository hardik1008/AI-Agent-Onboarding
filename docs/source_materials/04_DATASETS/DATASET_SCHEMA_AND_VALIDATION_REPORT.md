## 3. Data Integrity & Validation Findings

During automated inspection of the original datasets, the following validation characteristics were confirmed:
1. **Referential Integrity:** All 21,188 events in `stage_events.csv` reference valid `application_id` entries in `applications.csv`. All 3,600 documents in `documents.csv` map to the 600 applications in `application_truth.csv`.
2. **Aadhaar Masking Compliance:** All records in both `applications.csv` and `documents.csv` store only the last 4 digits of Aadhaar (prefixed with `XXXX-XXXX-`). Zero 12-digit plaintext Aadhaar numbers exist.
3. **Event Timeline Consistency:** All timestamps in `stage_events.csv` follow strict monotonic ordering (`APPLICATION_STARTED` <= `DOCS_UPLOADED` <= `KYC_VERIFIED` <= `TRAINING_COMPLETED` <= `EXAM_PASSED` <= `CERTIFICATE_ISSUED`).
4. **Benchmark Distribution:** The 600 ground truth test cases in `application_truth.csv` are distributed across: 272 APPROVE (45.3%), 184 NEEDS_MORE_INFO (30.7%), and 144 REJECT (24.0%), providing balanced evaluation power across all defect types.
