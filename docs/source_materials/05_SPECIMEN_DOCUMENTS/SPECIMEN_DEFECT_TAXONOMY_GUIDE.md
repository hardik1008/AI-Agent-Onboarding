## 2. Comprehensive Defect Analysis by Category

### 2.1 Image Quality Defects (Verdict: `REUPLOAD`)

| Defect Code | Computer Vision Indicator | Root Cause | Rework Action | Automated Messaging Template |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `IMAGE_BLURRY` | Laplacian variance < 100.0 or OCR word confidence < 0.75 | Camera shake, out-of-focus mobile capture, low lighting | Request new photograph in daylight | *"Your {doc_name} photo is blurry, and we could not clearly read required fields like {field_name}. Please retake in bright natural light with steady focus: {upload_link}"* |
| `IMAGE_CROPPED` | Edge detection fails to find 4 document corners; bounding box intersects canvas boundary | Applicant clipped card edge, cut off signature or DOB | Request full uncropped capture | *"A portion of your {doc_name} is cut off outside the camera frame. Please ensure all four corners and edges of the card are clearly visible: {upload_link}"* |
| `IMAGE_GLARE` | Specular reflection detected; local pixel luminance saturation (> 245) over text region | Direct flash or overhead bulb reflection washing out text | Request capture without flash | *"Direct light reflection or flash hides key information on your {doc_name}. Please retake without camera flash or angle the phone away from direct lights: {upload_link}"* |

### 2.2 Statutory Disqualifications (Verdict: `REJECT`)

| Defect Code | Detection Rule | Statutory Basis | System Action | Rework Permitted? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `UNDERAGE` | `application_date - DOB < 18.0 years` | IRDAI Guidelines §4(a) | Terminal rejection. Account locked. | No. May reapply upon reaching age 18. |
| `PAN_FORMAT_INVALID` | Regex `^[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]$` fails | Income Tax Act §139A | Terminal rejection. | No. Invalid statutory document. |
| `PAN_NOT_INDIVIDUAL` | PAN character 4 != `'P'` (e.g. `'C'`, `'F'`, `'T'`, `'H'`) | Only individuals may act as POSPs | Terminal rejection. | No. Entity cannot be onboarded as POSP. |
| `EDU_NOT_ELIGIBLE` | Class 10 result != `PASS` or unaccredited board | IRDAI Guidelines §4(b) | Terminal rejection. | No. Minimum educational threshold not satisfied. |
| `ALREADY_REGISTERED`| POSP Registry query returns active sponsorship hit | IRDAI Exclusivity Mandate | Terminal rejection until NOC uploaded. | Conditional: Allowed only upon formal de-registration. |

### 2.3 Consistency & Rework Defects (Verdict: `NEEDS_INFO`)

| Defect Code | Detection Rule | Resolution Path | Automation Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NAME_SPELLING_VARIANT`| Jaro-Winkler >= 0.85 or Levenshtein <= 2 (e.g. `LAKSHMI` vs `LAXMI`) | Request supporting identity document or affidavit | Send consolidated WhatsApp/SMS notification; allow applicant to confirm canonical spelling |
| `DOB_MISMATCH` | PAN DOB != Aadhaar DOB or Marksheet DOB | Golden anchor is PAN DOB | If Aadhaar has year-only matching PAN year: AUTO-PASS. If full date conflict: Request clarification |
| `BANK_NAME_MISMATCH` | Penny-drop name similarity < Tier 4 | Account must be in applicant's own name | Request cancelled cheque or bank statement showing applicant as sole or primary holder |
| `FACE_MATCH_LOW` | Face embedding cosine similarity < 0.60 | Low lighting, heavy filter, or wrong person | Request real-time liveness selfie. If 2nd attempt fails: Route to Fraud Desk |

## 3. Ground Truth Calibration Rules

1. **Rule of Single-Pass Rework:** If an application has both `IMAGE_BLURRY` on Marksheet and `BANK_NAME_MISMATCH` on Cheque, the system MUST emit a single notification itemizing both defects. Never ask for one document at a time.
2. **Rule of Human Confirmation for Rejection on Identity:** When `NAME_MISMATCH` is flagged, the system MUST NOT auto-reject without human review, ensuring false positives from OCR failures do not penalize genuine applicants.
3. **Informational Mismatches:** Address state discrepancies (`ADDRESS_STATE_MISMATCH`) between Aadhaar and declared form must NEVER trigger rework or rejection; they are informational only.
